# SETI-kaggle
EDA and training modules for kaggle SETI competition 
this repository tracks my submission and strategy for kaggle challenge in SETI obervations.

## Dataset
--- The dataset consists of snippet files in float16 format(v1.20.1) one file per cadence id with corresponding labels found in train_labels.csv. Each file has (6, 273. 256) first dimension gives the positions of the cadence.

--- So for example 1-data,2-background, 3-data, 4-background, 5-data, 6- background



---  Your challenge is to train an algorithm to find as many needles as you can, while minimizing the number of false positives from the haystack.
